The Odin Project Google Homepage Project

I had to take a lot of time to learn how to properly use flexbox.
Things to improve: Search bar, Had trouble figuring out how to position it and I tried my best.
Overall this was a nice intro into html and Css and taught me to not be a perfectionist and changed my mindset when it comes to learning.
I am looking forward to doing more projects.
